Argentina tops the South American qualifying standings with 28 points, boasting nine wins, one draw, and three losses. Their recent 1-0 victory over Uruguay, courtesy of a brilliant strike from Thiago Almada, ended a three-game winless streak in away qualifiers. Securing a draw against Brazil would mathematically confirm Argentina’s World Cup qualification.

It will be the 115th meeting between the two, with a place at the 2026 World Cup at stake for the defending champions.

A win for Argentina will extend their lead at the top of the qualifying standings to 31 points, cementing their place inside the top six.

Last week’s win in Uruguay – courtesy of Thiago Almada’s wonderful goal – pushed Lionel Scaloni’s men to the brink of qualification for next summer’s World Cup finals as they seek to defend the crown they won in Qatar in 2022.

Brazil, meanwhile, will be in search of three points to continue their push for a guaranteed spot. The Selecao currently sit in third on 21 points.

Many bettors are backing Argentina to extend their lead, with various markets available on 1xBet Promo Code for this high-stakes clash.

Currently without Lionel Messi, Lionel Scaloni’s side have won three of their last four games, including a 0-1 victory to Uruguay in their last outing.

Brazil holds third place with 21 points. After a sluggish start to their qualification journey, they have regained momentum with a five-game unbeaten run, highlighted by a dramatic 2-1 win over Colombia, clinched by Vinicius Junior’s goal in the 99th minute.

Copa America holders and world champions Argentina have led the way from the very start, and they're now six points clear at the top of the table after edging past Uruguay last time out. With Bolivia 15 points back in seventh, Lionel Scaloni's side have the chance to secure qualification against the Selecao.

Almada stepped up in a revamped forward line missing Lionel Messi, Lautaro Martinez and Paulo Dybala to score the only goal in Montevideo.

Scaloni said afterwards: “We had some very important absentees but we have great players to go out on the field. The team is always more than just the names.”

Argentina may even qualify prior to the Brazil game if Bolivia fail to beat Uruguay in a fixture that kicks off four hours earlier.

Either way, La Albiceleste are in a very strong position, as are Brazil for whom the win over Colombia last week means they are almost certain to advance.

Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos said: “We knew how important this could be, after two draws, and our standing in the table.

Argentina currently enjoy a three-point lead at the top of the South American qualification section, having won nine, drawn one and lost three of their 13 qualifiers, scoring 22 goals during that period and conceding on just seven occasions.

A dramatic 2-1 victory over Colombia on Friday means Brazil are now sitting pretty in third, but this qualifying campaign has been a slog for the five-time World Cup winners. However, Dorival Junior has stumbled upon some stability and has facilitated an uptick in results in recent breaks.

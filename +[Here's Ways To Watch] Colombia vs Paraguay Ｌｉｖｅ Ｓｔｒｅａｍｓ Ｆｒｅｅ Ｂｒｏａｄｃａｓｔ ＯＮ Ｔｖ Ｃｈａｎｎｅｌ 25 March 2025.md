James Rodriguez and Co. will be at home and will desperately be looking for a win here. The Colombia national football team have won five games in the 13 World Cup qualification games. Only the top six teams will make it to the 2026 FIFA World Cup and they are sitting comfortably in sixth place. Still they will be looking for a win here.

Colombia will be looking to make up for lost form in their World Cup qualification campaign when they take on Paraguay at Estadio Metropolitano on Tuesday.

In fact, after staying unbeaten in the first eight matchdays of the qualifiers, Los Cefetoros have suffered all their four losses in their last five outings. Coming off a 2-1 defeat against Brazil, Colombia are a point off Paraguay on the standings table.

Colombia has been one of the most stable teams in South America in recent years. They spent half of the qualifying cycle at a high level, contending for the top spot with Argentina.

In the last five matches, the team suffered four defeats, which affected their position in the standings. Colombia is in sixth place but is six points ahead of Bolivia, who is right behind them. Losing a direct World Cup spot with five rounds left in the qualification would require a significant effort.

Paraguay relies on a tough, physically robust style of play. However, in recent matches, the "Guarani" have struggled with scoring. The attack, led by Miguel Almiron and Julio, hasn't always been productive, though the defense has been very reliable.

Remarkably, in 13 matches, Paraguay managed to score 20 points while netting only 9 goals. Interestingly, only Peru scored less, having earned half as many points.

The Colombians are fresh off a heartbreaking loss to Brazil in Brasilia, holding the South American giants to a draw until Vinicius Jr scored the winning goal in the 99th minute to give the hosts a 2-1 victory.

On the other hand, Gustavo Alfaro's side started poorly but gradually picked up positive results along the way, including victories over the likes of Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. La Albirroja beat Chile 1-0 last Thursday.

The Paraguay national football team have shown some good performances and will be looking to continue their form. But their upcoming clash against the Los Cafeteros is going to be a tough affair. Paraguay have faced difficulties in facing this opposition previously and the hosts will make sure to pressurise them.

Colombia needs a result on Tuesday, having lost their last three qualifiers against Brazil, Ecuador and Uruguay. Their last win came in October, when they beat bottom-dwellers Chile 4-0.

Paraguay, meanwhile, are undefeated over their last seven qualifying matches, notably beating both Argentina and Brazil over that span. La Albirroja beat Chile 1-0 in Asunción on Thursday, thanks to a 60th-minute strike by Omar Alderete.

Colombia and Paraguay have met on 50 previous occasions, with Colombia winning 24 times, compared to Paraguay's 18 wins. Colombia has not lost to their South American rivals since October 2017, winning four out of six contests since then.

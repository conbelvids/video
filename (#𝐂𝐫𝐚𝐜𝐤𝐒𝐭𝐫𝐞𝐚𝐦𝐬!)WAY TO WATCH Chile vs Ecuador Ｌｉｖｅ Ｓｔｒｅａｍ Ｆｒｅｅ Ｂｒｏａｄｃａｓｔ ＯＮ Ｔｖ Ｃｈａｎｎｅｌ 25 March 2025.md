Get ready for a must-watch showdown in Matchday 14 of the CONMEBOL Qualifiers, where Chile face a crucial test in their World Cup hopes. A loss could leave Arturo Vidal and his teammates on the edge of elimination, making this match a do-or-die situation.

Ever since getting knocked out of Copa America in 2024 by Canada, Chile have had a rotten run in the qualifying matches, currently sitting rock bottom of the CONMEBOL table, losing all but two of their 13 games so far.

Ricardo Gareca is the latest manager to charge of La Roja, hoping to cause a turnaround in their fortunes. However, it will be a tough ask to get any kind of positive result against a high-flying Ecuador side, who are second only to Argentina in the qualifying table.

The progress of the Ecuadorian national team has been nothing short of extraordinary, especially over the past 25 years. The team, known as "La Tri," made its World Cup debut in 2002 during the tournament in Japan and South Korea, while Chile finished at the bottom of the standings in that qualifying round. Since then, Ecuador has qualified for four World Cups, double the appearances of Chile, which participated only in 2010 in South Africa and 2014 in Brazil.

They are on a three-game winning streak, having lost only one of their last 12 World Cup qualifying matches. In fact, Ecuador have only lost three of their last 14 World Cup qualifying games against Chile.

Sebastian Beccacece‚Äôs side has been in terrific form, with Enner Valencia finding his scoring touch in the last three matches with four goals. They will be strong favourites for Tuesday‚Äôs match, and will look to make sure that Chile miss out on the third-successive World Cup campaign.

It has been a gruelling 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign for Chile, who host second-placed Ecuador in Santiago this week.

Ricardo Gareca‚Äôs side are rooted at the bottom of the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying table. They are desperately trying to keep pace with the likes of Venezuela and Bolivia for a chance in the playoffs.

Peru's home win over Bolivia has seen them overtake Chile once more, and losing at home to La Verde in September could end up being very costly for La Roja.

Chile are still only four points off the playoff place, but with four teams battling it out for that honour, dropped points both home and away must be avoided from this point on, with just five games remaining.

Gareca will have been glad to see Venezuela fall to another defeat last week, as they remain within touching distance of the side they beat 4-2 in November, but that will be irrelevant if they cannot pick up maximum points here at home.

Chile lost the reverse fixture 1-0 back in November 2023, and they were also beaten at home by Ecuador in qualifying for the last World Cup, so there is little down for the hosts, especially when the visiting side's form is taken into consideration.

Chile missed out on a golden opportunity to close the gap to Bolivia and Venezuela last week, losing 1-0 to Paraguay. La Roja dominated the first 45 minutes but missed a glut of chances, before the Paraguayans took control in the second half.

These achievements are not merely coincidences but rather the result of consistent efforts at the grassroots level to nurture talent. A testament to this is Ecuador‚Äôs third-place finish in the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Poland, a remarkable feat achieved after winning the South American U-20 Championship the same year with standout forward Gonzalo Plata leading the charge.

At the other end of the spectrum, Ecuador have been in fine form and are on the cusp of qualifying for next summer‚Äôs finals already. This would be a superb achievement, since Ecuador have only qualified for back-to-back World Cups once before.

The secret to the success of Sebastian Beccacece‚Äôs squad has been their defensive resilience. In a qualifying campaign involving the likes of Argentina and Brazil, Ecuador have conceded just five goals in 13 games.

The current Ecuadorian squad also boasts an impressive lineup. As of now, they occupy second place in the South American World Cup qualifying standings with 22 points. They could be higher, but an ongoing FIFA sanction regarding the eligibility of defender Byron Castillo, initiated by the an Football Federation prior to the Qatar 2022 World Cup, has impacted their points. Currently, the market valuation of 's national team is estimated to be around $300 million, making it the fifth most valuable team in this South American qualifying round. This market assessment is dwarfed by Brazil, which tops the list at $1.063 billion according to data from the German site Transfermarkt.
